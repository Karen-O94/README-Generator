# README-Generator

## Description
The aim of this project was to create a command-line application to quickly generate a high quality README file with an inbuilt layout that is populated with the user's responses about their repository.

## Installation
In order to generate your own README, you will need to run `npm i inquirer` in order to install the 'inquirer' package dependencies as specified in the package.json.

The inquirer package will give you access to a series of prompts to answer within the command line/terminal 

Once inquirer is installed, you can initialise the application itself by running `node index.js` in the command line

## Usage 

*Please see the video walkthrough for this application below*

After running `node index.js` within the command line, the inquirer package will prompt users to answer a series of questions based on your GitHub repository, project, it's functionality and contact links.

The application takes in the user's reponses and populates the `data` parameter with its specified response object of the `generateMarkdown()` function with the corresponding response. For example,`${data.github}` is populated with the user's github username in the markdown file. 

The actual README file is then generated by using the `fs.writeFileSync`. You can see the sample README created in the Develop folder of this repository. 

## Final Product
The generated README file should contain the following:

    - Project Title and description
    - License information including license badge and link to the license
    - Table of contents with links to each heading of the README
    - Links to the user's GitHub profile and username
    - Installation, Usage, Testing, Credits, Contributions sections describing how users can use, test or contribute to the application
