# README-Generator

## Description
The aim of this project was to create a command-line application to quickly generate a high quality README file with an inbuilt layout that is populated with the user's responses about their repository. 

## Installation
In order to generate your own README, you will need to run `npm i inquirer` in order to install the 'inquirer' package dependencies as specified in the package.json.

The inquirer package will give you access to a series of prompts to answer within the command line/terminal 

Once inquirer is installed, you can initialise the application itself by running `node index.js` in the command line
